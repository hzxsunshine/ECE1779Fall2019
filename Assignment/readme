Assignment 1.
Author: Zixuan Hu

Important thing:
I will add an instruction later.

Instruction:
1. Set database;
2. Run the flask:
  I create a virtual env to run the flask:
    by using python3: 
       python3 -m venv venv
       source ./venv/bin/activate
    this command line works for my macOS
    for windows OS:
      python3 -m venv venv
      ./venv/bin/activate
  
  then set the env for flask:
    EXPORT FLASK_APP=main.py
    EXPORT FLASK_ENV=development
    flask run
  for windows user:
    set FLASK_APP=main.py
    set FLASK_ENV=development
    flask run
  Hope this works.
  
feel free to ask me if you meet any question.
